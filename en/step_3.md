## Make a tiled floor

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Use your single tile to create an 8 by 8 tiled floor.
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
An <span style="color: #0faeb0">**array modifier**</span> creates copies of an oject that can be offset to create a pattern of repetative objects. An Architect could use an array modifier to create a spiral staircase for a home from just one step. Or when designing a model for an office building they could copy a car in a parking space to create a full carpark.</p>
