### Blender animation path

Our [Blender basics](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/blender-basics) path covers how to create, animate and render 3D objects and scenes to make a Snow scene animation:

**Tip:** In this path you will create a snowman, trees, a car, a house, and a rocket. Think about how you could use Array modifiers to create a row of houses or a car park full of cars. 

### More Unity path

The tiled floor from this **Blender - Create a 3D tiled floor** project and the material from the [Blender - Add material effects to a marble](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/blender-marble) project can be exported and used in our [More Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/more-unity) path.

**Tip:** If you have not used Unity before you can start with our [Introduction to Unity](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/unity-intro) path to make 3D worlds with quests and games.
