To turn the 3D Cube object into a shorter 3D tile shape, you decreased the value in the **Scale** property for the axis that points up.

Which axis points up in Blender?

--- choices ---

- ( ) X-axis

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. This is not the axis that points up in Blender.

- ( ) Y-axis

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. This is not the axis that points up in Blender.

- (x) Z-axis

  --- feedback ---

  That's right. In the coordinate system used by Blender, the z-axis points up. Changing the **Scale Z** property makes the object taller or shorter.
