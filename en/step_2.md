A new Blender project always includes a **Cube** object. The cube has an orange outline to show it is the selected object:

If you do not have a computer mouse with a scroll wheel, you can use the navigation icons. 

Place the mouse over the **Zoom** or **Move** icon and the cursor will change to four arrows. 

Click and hold with the left mouse button and drag the mouse around to change the view.

To rotate the view, click and hold on the **Orbit** icon and drag the mouse around.

Click on the **Object Properties** icon to open the Object Properties tab.

Go to the **Transform** settings and find **Scale**. Change the **Z** (upâ€“down) axis property to `0.3`:

In the Object Properties tab, the Scale Z property is highlighted and the value is set to 0.300. In the 3D view, the 3D cube object now has a smaller height.](images/object-properties.png)

**Tip:** In the coordinate system used by Blender, the **z-axis** points up. You might have used another coordinate system; for example, in some software, such as Unity, the y-axis points up.
