## You will make

In this project, you will create a 3D tiled floor in Blender. Blender is a free and open source 3D creation package for designers, engineers and artists. 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
One of the amazing uses of <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Blender**</span> was by **Israeli 3D designer Danit Peleg** who designed a 3D printed dress for the Paralympics Opening Ceremony in Brazil. The dress was worn by **American Paralympian Snowboarder Amy Purdy** during a headline dance at the ceremony. The dress worn by Amy, who had to have both legs amputated below the knee, was printed in the same material as Amy's prosthetic feet. </p>

You will:
+ Create a single tile from a 3D cube **object**
+ Change object **modifier properties** to make your tile more realistic
+ Use an **array modifier** to build a tiled floor
