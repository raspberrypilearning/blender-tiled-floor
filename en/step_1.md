One use of <span style="color: #0faeb0">**Blender**</span> was by 🇮🇱 Israeli 3D designer Danit Peleg who designed a 3D printed dress for the Paralympics Opening Ceremony in 🇧🇷 Brazil. The dress was worn by 🇺🇸 American Paralympian Snowboarder Amy Purdy during a headline dance at the ceremony. The dress worn by Amy, who had to have both legs amputated below the knee, was printed in the same material as Amy's prosthetic feet. </p>
